[Ojingeo](https://ojingeo.ndureja.com) is a squid game management application. It features 2 portals, one for the frontman to manage players and works i.e. to eliminate, edit or create new entries and switch to the next game.</br>
The other portal is for the VIPs for betting on the players. It also features a completely functional bitcoin payment mechanism through which the VIPs can make payments.  
The website was initially hosted through onion routing i.e. only accessible through dark web to preserve the anonymity of the VIPs.
